"""
Application Context System for Ember Framework

This module implements Ember's application context architecture, providing a dependency
injection system and global service management. The context serves as the composition
root for framework services, while offering thread-safe singleton access when needed.

The design supports both direct dependency injection for components and convenient
global access for application code, with special accommodations for testing scenarios.

class EmberContext:
    """
    Thread-safe global access point for Ember's core service architecture.

    The EmberContext combines three critical design patterns to provide a robust
    foundation for the framework:

    1. Singleton Pattern: Guarantees a single global instance in standard usage,
       ensuring consistent state and memory efficiency

    2. Lazy Initialization: Defers resource creation until first access, avoiding
       circular dependencies and reducing startup overhead

    3. Test Mode Pattern: Provides a configurable escape hatch from the singleton
       constraint specifically for testing scenarios, enabling isolated test contexts

    This hybrid approach satisfies both production needs (centralized, consistent access)
    and testing requirements (isolation, deterministic setup/teardown). All operations
    are thread-safe through careful lock management, making the context suitable for
    concurrent applications.

    The EmberContext implements the Facade pattern, providing simplified access to
    the underlying service architecture through property accessors while encapsulating
    all initialization complexity.

    For internal use, consider direct dependency injection. This global context
    is primarily intended for application code that cannot easily receive injected
    dependencies.

        This method serves as the canonical initialization point for the EmberContext,

        scenarios. It handles thread synchronization, singleton enforcement (when not
        in test mode), and lifecycle management.

        The implementation follows a clear priority order for initialization sources:
        1. If app_context is provided, it is used directly (full DI scenario)
        2. If only config_path is provided, a new app_context is created using that path
        3. If neither is provided, default configuration discovery is used

        This flexibility enables multiple initialization patterns:
        - Standard usage: EmberContext.initialize()
        - Custom config: EmberContext.initialize(config_path="/path/to/config.yaml")
        - Mock services: EmberContext.initialize(app_context=mock_context)
